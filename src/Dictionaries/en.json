      "Since 19 years I have been working in the field of web development. Iâ€™ve been create game simulations on ReactJS for 2 years, then went to the programming school to teach, but in the end I became the head of the training part and now I am writing training courses on frontend-development and supervising teachers with mentors. In parallel, doing self-pumping. The site on which you are currently located is just the place where I test everything I have learned."
